Differences between Arrays amd linked arrays lists

1.Memory Allocation - in Arrays its fixed speed and is stored in the contiguous memory.

                    - in linked lists its dynamic size where the nodes are stored in different
                      memory locations.

                      
2. Performance      - in arrays it has fast access (O(1)) using index but slow insert / delete (O(n)) .

                    - in linked lists it has slower access (O(n)) but fast insert / delete (O(1)) .


3.Insertion and deletion - in arrays it requires shifting elements making is slower .

                         - in linked lists only pointer adjustments are needed to making it efficient .
