What is big notation? Big O is used in algorithms analysis to describe the worst case ,time complexity and space complexity ,
                     as the input size grows .It helps describe the efficiency of the algorithm.

Common Big O notation complexities are:
         .Constant time O(1) - The execution time remains constant regardless of the input size  eg accesaign a array element.
         . Logarithmic time O( log n) - The execution time increases logarithimically e.g Binary search .
         . Linear time O(n) - The execution time increases propotionally with the input size e.g looping an array
         . Quadratic time O(n^2) - The execution time grows exponentially as input size increases eg Nested loops.
         . Expotential time O(2^n) - The execution time doubles with every new input eg Recursive Fibonacci sequence .

         example of Time complexity in a loop
         o(n) complexity : Linear time for (int i = 0;i < n ;i++) {
                          system.out.println(i);
                          }
